Good morning, dear professor. Thanks you for giving me the opportunity to have this interview. I graduated from Hunan Institute of Science and Technology in Yueyang, a famous city, and my major is Information Engineering.

Since I entered my university, I have been studying hard. And I have passed CET-4 in my second of university. I love to use computer programming technology and skills to solve practical problems, so I actively participate and prepare for various computer programming competitions every year, and I won the third prize in the China Collegiate Programming Contest in my sophomore year. But when I finished my study, I realized that what I have learned is not enough. I would like to further my study, so I choose to continue my interest with a master’s degree. 

If I am lucky enough to be a student of this great university, I will try my best to develop my abilities in related aspects and try to be a qualified graduate. After three years of study, I will become a more useful person to society

That’s all about me. Thank you.
